        <h2 className='hh5'>Our Story</h2>
        <p className='p6'>Founded by a group of avid travelers who believe in the magic of discovering new places
        and cultures, Wandering Souls was born out of the desire to create a space where every
        traveler could find inspiration,assistance, and a community of like-minded explorers.
        Our founders realized that the journey itself is just as important as the destination, and
        they set out to build a platform that caters to the diverse tastes and preferences of the
        global travel community.
